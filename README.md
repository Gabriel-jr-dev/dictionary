# Dictionary (English → English)

An offline English dictionary built with Expo, React Native, and TypeScript. The application loads a curated SQLite
snapshot generated from the WordNet corpus and supports instant prefix and full-text lookup for definitions and usage
examples.

## Features

- 📚 **WordNet-backed content** – only English definitions and usage examples are bundled.
- 🔍 **Hybrid search** – prefix matching for fast word lookup plus FTS-powered definition search.
- 📱 **Expo/React Native UI** – clean search experience with reusable components.
- 🗃️ **Sandboxed database** – automatic copy of the bundled SQLite file to the device sandbox.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm 9 or newer
- Python 3.9+

## Install JavaScript dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Generate the SQLite database

Binary assets cannot be committed to this repository, so the SQLite dictionary must be generated locally before running
the app. The ETL script builds `assets/databases/base.sqlite` from the WordNet corpus:

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the ETL script:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/build_wordnet_sqlite.py
   ```

The script downloads the WordNet corpus via NLTK (first run only), extracts every lemma, definition, and usage example,
and builds the SQLite database with an FTS5 virtual table for search. Re-run the command whenever you need to refresh the
database.

> **Note:** Only English→English content (definitions and usage examples) is included in the generated database.

## Run the Expo development server

Make sure `assets/databases/base.sqlite` exists (generated by the ETL script) before starting the packager.

```bash
npx expo start
```

Use the terminal prompts to open the project in Expo Go, an emulator, or a development build.

## Database module

The React Native client uses `lib/database.ts` to copy `base.sqlite` from the app bundle into the sandbox (`documentDirectory/SQLite`)
and exposes helpers for prefix and full-text searches. Results are parsed into strongly typed `DictionaryEntry` objects
for the UI components.
